# EPAM - Performance development plan (PDP)

1. ## Scala theoretical foundations

    After presenting the assessment for level up to A3, the committee of experts identified the following improvement opportunities  regarding Scala and Functional programming

    - monads, Scala common/design patterns, type erasure, implicit classes, smart constructors
    - Scala 3 experience

    Studying these materials focuses on improving areas, the idea is to add to this GitHub repository and also to https://github.com/raulramirezp/essential-scala the uncovered topics as part of my self-study and in order to demonstrate that the topics were revised and applied

    ### Materials
    - [More about Modas and FP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJGDHERh23x-9bxGrCbyX-tXJG99XczNC)
    - [Playlist for Scala FP design patterns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJGDHERh23x9Wzcbc7j9ZDl03tKQF5QDN)

    - [monads do not compose](https://blog.tmorris.net/posts/monads-do-not-compose/)


2. ## Read more about microservice architecture and monolithic one
   After presenting the assessment for level up to A3, the committee of experts identified the following improvement opportunities regarding Microservices and monolithic architecture.

   The attached materials contain relevant information about monolithic and microservices architecture.

   Chapter of Mark Richards and Neal Ford book's:
    - Architectural styles - Monolithic vs Distributed architectures
    - Microservice architecture
    - Choosing the appropriate architectural style

    After reading about that I going to create a file inside this repository describing both monolithic and microservices architecture and talking about the advantages and disadvantages of each one

    ### Materials
    - [[Book] fundamentals of software by Mark Richards, Neal Ford](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/)
    - [AWS lecture about monolithic and microservices architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-monolithic-and-microservices-architecture/)

3. ## DB Normalization

   After presenting the assessment for level up to A3, the committee of experts identified the following improvement opportunities  regarding SQL databases:

    * Knowledge about DB normalization

    The attached materials cover this topic with nice examples to well understand the DB normalization process

    ### Materials
    - [Learn Database Normalization - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF, 5NF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFQaEYEc8_8)
    - [Microsoft blog regarding DB normalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/access/database-normalization-description)

4. ## Improving knowledge in Non SQL Databases

    After presenting the assessment for level up to A3, the committee of experts identified the following improvement opportunities  regarding NOSQL databases:

    - Different types of NoSQL DBs (document oriented, key-value etc)
    - Replication, sharding, partitioning 
    - CAP theorem (distributed systems) 

    The attached LinkedIn course covers all the main topics regarding NoSQL databases including the topics recommended by the experts to be studied 

    ### Materials
    - [NoSQL Essential Training](https://learn.epam.com/catalog/detailsPage?id=b6caac6b-afbc-4c0f-9f17-ebc862603cf3)
